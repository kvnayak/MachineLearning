    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Real-world application- used for marking some of the mails as spam in the inbox, where the algorithm is one that classifies an incoming email as spam or not spam depending on use of certain words or expression.\n",
    "- Strengths- can be used to train a large training set which would allow us to better assume that samples are \"independent\" of each other.\n",
    "- Weaknesses- considering features as independent could be a strong assumption and unrealistic for real data.\n",
    "- This model as a good candidate for the problem- because this problem has a large set of input data with few features GaussianNB is suitable for solving this. Also the size will not create a problem because the implementation is easy and fast and doesn’t require too much memory and can be used for simple learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Decision Trees\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Real-world application- Fraud is a major problem for many industries. Using classification tree, a business can detect frauds beforehand and can drop fraudulent customers.\n",
    "- Strengths- This method is easy to interpret and explain. Decision trees perform quite well with boolean functions. The visualization of problem becomes easier hence aids in solving the problem better looking at the features.\n",
    "- Weaknesses- The modification of a single variable may change the whole tree if this variable is located near the top of the tree. Also they easily overfit.\n",
    "- This model as a good candidate for the problem- Decision Trees do not require any special preparation for input data. It handles multi featured data easily, and also helps in visualizing features helpful in making better intepretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Logistic Regression\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Real-world application- used in image segmentation and categorization in medical fields for diagnosis, geographic image processing for analyzing the image data for information. \n",
    "- Strengths-  Logistic Regression is Simple to understand and explain, pretty robust to noise and you can avoid overfitting and even do feature selection by using l2 or l1 regularization. It is fast to train and asy to train on big data.\n",
    "- Weaknesses- Logistic Regression can suffer from outliers. Also we'll have to work to make it fit nonlinear functions because it assumes a linear decision boundary which sometimes might not be the case.\n",
    "- This model as a good candidate for the problem- Because our problem has a huge, qualitative data inputs - Logistic Regression works well and fast. Also since ours is a binary classification type problem it responds fast and with quite a good accuracy.\n",

It is visible in the performs metrics that with increase in training set size the GaussianNB performs poorly. \n",

But it does not perform better than logistic regression(i.e both Accuracy and F-score of decision tree drastically decreases) when seen working on test set- which is a classic case of overfitting. Hence when it comes to this- Logistic Regression is of choice for this problem.\n",

This boundary will be decided by input data and the learning algorithm. The logistic function transforms any value into the range 0 to 1.

Also penalty parameter refers to the way errors are measured (i.e (L^2) is used to minimize total squared error, while (L^1) minimizes the total absolute value of error).\n",
    "* Hence after fine tuning the algorithm- the performance does increase but by a very low margin."

    "## Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset."

    "When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?"

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Age- Person who is experienced and have been working for long is expected to be at a higher position in job or own business and hence earn better than one who has just started working.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Education level- As most qualified indivduals are known to take better position/ have ideas to expand business, they are definitely valued more and hence earn really well and donate for the charity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Occupation- Depending on the occupation the individual could be predicted for donation- because if an individual is working in a clerical post, small service jobs he/she not expected to earn more than 50K, where individual with a special profesion job or is a businessman owning a huge company or CEO of a company then he/she is expected to earn more and donate for the charity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Hours-per-week- if a individual works for more than average expected hours per week then he/she would earn more than the one who works less.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Marital-status- if an individual is married then there is a chance they might have expenses of the family to cover and hence would not donate."

Now if we think of it, the educational number would be a better and accurate measure of education/qualification status of an individual. Hence education-num is a relevent featutre.\n",
    "* Also the visualization shows capital-gain which was not thought of as a relevent feature because it is mostly situational (i.e capital gain was thought of a quantity if only the property were bought/ sold, economic status of the country etc) but it could be an indiactor of the properties/shares owned i.e the total wealth of an individual which would definetly help in classifying if that indicvidual makes more than 50k."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
